## Mentor
MENTOR NAME HERE

## Current Status
In Progress

## Project Overview

I want to recreate the Nintendo Entertainment System's hardware using an FPGA in order to use hardware emulation to play games.
## Educational Value Added

During this project I will learn CPU Design, Audio Proccesing Unit Design, and Video and Graphics processing, grabbing memory from catridges etc. As well as 
topics related to working with FPGA and FPGA software tools

## Tasks

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->
High levels tasks
Learn about the NES CPU design -> Port that Design to an FPGA using System Verilog -> Intergrate with other pieces
Learn about the NES APU design -> Port that Design to an FPGA using System Verilog -> Intergrate with other pieces
Learn about the NES Video Process and Graphic design -> Port that Design to an FPGA using System Verilog -> Intergrate with other pieces
Learn about the Input design -> Port that Design to an FPGA using System Verilog -> Intergrate with other pieces
etc until done

## Design Decisions

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->
TBD -> What brand of FPGA (Intel or AMD) and which developer kit.
Xlinx Zybo FPGA
## Design Misc

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->
Find resources that relate to each part-> write thoughts -> commment code -> Keep engineering notebook
github

## BOM + Component Cost

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->
TBD depends on the FPGA

## Timeline

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->
I would like to have the CPU and APU done by the end of Fall 2024 and if I still allowed in the amp lab during my grad school finish the project before I leave grad school
